"""A generic action on the System Under Test (SUT)."""

class SUTAction(abc.ABC):
    """A generic action on the System Under Test (SUT).

    This class is the base class for a framework for defining operations
    on the System Under Test (SUT). An action is supposed to be any kind of
    operation that can be performed on the SUT, such as a procedure, a
    command, or a generic interaction.

    We provide this because we assume that a wide enough testing
    operations have the following common features:

    - the core part is a procedure (e.g.Â¸ a sequence of one or more commands
    but also a sequence of generic interaction, mostly with Tango devices
    but not necessarily)
    - to be executed, they may assume some preconditions (none by default)
    - after the procedure is executed, they may guarantee some postconditions
    (none by default)
    - they have a name (by default, the class name) and a brief semantic
    description of the operation (by default, nothing)
    - they may be run several times, given the preconditions are satisfied
    - the user may want to log their execution

    **How to use an action as an end user**: An end user can use actions
    simply by creating an instance of the action and calling the
    :py:meth:`execute` method. The action will be executed, and the
    preconditions and postconditions will be verified. The execution
    can be repeated as many times as the user wants, given the
    preconditions are satisfied. Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        action = MyAction()
        action.execute()

    **How to extend an action**: An action can be extended by subclassing
    it and overriding some of the extension points. The extension points are:

    - :py:meth:`setup`: set up the action (optional)
    - :py:meth:`verify_preconditions`: verify the preconditions (optional)
    - :py:meth:`execute_procedure`: act on the SUT (**compulsory**)
    - :py:meth:`verify_postconditions`: verify the postconditions (optional)
    - :py:meth:`name`: a name to identify the action (optional)
    - :py:meth:`description`: a brief description of the action (optional)

    As you may guess, the first four extension points are the steps of
    the action execution. The last two extension points are used to
    identify and describe the action in the logs and in the reports. Example:

    # TODO: add example

    # TODO: add logging mechanism
