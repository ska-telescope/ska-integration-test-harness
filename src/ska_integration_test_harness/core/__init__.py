"""The core of the Integration Test Harness as a Platform.

This module provides the core classes and functions for the
Integration Test Harness as a Platform. The core classes are:

- generic (they don't even assume the fact we are testing a telescope, they
  are potentially suitable for integration testing any Tango-based system)
- reusable (they can be used in different testing contexts)
- extendable (they can be extended to adapt for your own specific case)
- unit tested (this is unit tested code, with a high coverage and you
  should expect it to be reliable and robust)
