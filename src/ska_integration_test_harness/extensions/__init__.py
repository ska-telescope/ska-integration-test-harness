"""A collection of Common Extensions for the ITH Core.

The Common Extensions are a collection of classes that extend and combine
the functionalities of the ITH :py:mod:`~ska_integration_test_harness.core`
module for typical SKA use cases.

While the core by itself doesn't know anything about telescopes, this
module instead embeds some knowledge about the SKA telescope and its
mechanisms. That said, what is in this module is still pretty generic
and is supposed to be reusable across different SKA testing
repositories and SKAO teams.
