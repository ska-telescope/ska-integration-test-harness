"""A collection of actions performed on TMC Central Node.

Some of the given actions are basic command calls (often followed by a
synchronisation on one or more expected state changes), while others are more
complex orchestrations (which occasionally include calls on the wrappers
to deal with complexities derived by the emulated-not emulated
status of the involved subsystems).
